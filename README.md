# Final-project-
Cloud raider - Art of Aws exploitation 

Misconfigurations in AWS services such as S3 buckets and EC2 instances pose serious security 
threats, mostly resulting in privilege escalation or data breaches. The project aims at illustrating 
real-world exploitation methods to showcase these vulnerabilities. It also investigates the 
capability of automated security tools and cloud monitoring solutions in identifying and 
remediating these threats before attackers can exploit them.

The research starts with the detection of shared S3 misconfigurations, e.g., public buckets or 
excessively liberal access policies, that attackers can use to read or exfiltrate confidential 
information. The project also explores EC2 misconfigurations, e.g., insecure SSH settings, 
vulnerable instance roles, and exposed metadata services, to illustrate how attackers can obtain 
unauthorized access or escalate their privileges in an AWS environment. The study also 
examines insecure API keys, inappropriately assigned IAM roles. Through the emulation of 
real-world attack conditions, the project presents potential effects of such exploits, such as 
compromised resources and data leakage. 

It also stresses the need to follow security best practices, including imposing least privilege, 
auditing access policies, and making instance metadata secure. In addition, the project points 
out the need for monitoring continuously, threat intelligence feeds, and employing automated 
remediation tactics in order to enhance AWS security posture. The research gives organizations 
actionable knowledge that they can use to secure their AWS environments from the same risks, 
supporting compliance with security industry standards and minimizing the attack surface 
within cloud infrastructures.
